# Engaging Experiment Template

**Purpose:** Create accessible standalone articles on experimental findings that can be enjoyed by readers who haven't seen the detailed version.

## Structure

1. **Title & Subtitle**
   - **Character count:** 4-5 words preferred for title
   - **Formatting:** Title Case
   - Title: 4-5 words with memorable phrasing
   - Subtitle: Clear, concise explanation (60-80 characters)
   - Example:
     - "AI's Memory Problem"
     - *When models forget what they just learned*

   **Error Prevention in Titles:**
   - Test titles against common misinterpretations before finalizing
   - Ensure titles avoid unintended double meanings that could mislead readers
   - Validate that wordplay clarifies rather than obscures the topic
   - Include enough specificity to set accurate expectations about content
   - When in doubt, prioritize clarity over cleverness

2. **Hook & TL;DR**
   - **Hook:** 2-3 sentences that immediately engage the reader by connecting to existing knowledge
   - **Style Guidance for Hooks:**
     - Option 1: Connect to a familiar design challenge readers already recognize
     - Option 2: Reference a widely understood problem before introducing a new perspective
     - Option 3: Build on existing mental models before expanding or challenging them
     - Option 4: Begin with concrete, relatable scenarios before moving to abstract concepts
     - Important: Apply the "recognition over recall" principle by referencing familiar concepts rather than requiring readers to recall new information
     - Important: Limit first-person perspective to situations where personal experience adds unique credibility; focus on insights rather than self-reference. Avoid fear-based hooks or FOMO tactics.
   
   - Hook Example: "The moment I realized my carefully crafted 300-word prompts were performing worse than my quick, messy requests was the moment I questioned everything I thought I knew about working with AI. What if prompt engineering's conventional wisdom is entirely backward?"
   
   - **TL;DR:** 60-100 words summarizing key content with outcome and bolded insights
   - **Style Guidance for TL;DR:**
     - Include the outcome/conclusion, not just the setup
     - Use **bold** for 1-2 key insights
     - Ensure it functions as a standalone mini-version of the entire piece
   
   - TL;DR Example: "**TL;DR:** Conventional prompt engineering wisdom has it backward. In my testing, messy but structurally sound prompts consistently outperformed "perfect" prompts across all major AI models. The most significant factor wasn't word choice or length, but **organizational clarity** – even when that organization came through bullet points and fragments. This challenges everything we've been told about crafting the "perfect prompt" and offers a much faster approach to getting quality results."

   **Balance information integrity with engagement:** All factual content should be presented without embellishment. When using scenarios or examples to illustrate concepts, ensure they're based on actual experiences rather than hypothetical situations. Storytelling elements should enhance understanding of factual information, not replace it. When sharing observations or experiences, clearly distinguish between established facts and pattern recognition or analysis.

3. **Relatable Mental Models**
   - **Word count:** 100-150 words
   - **Purpose:** Provide relatable conceptual frameworks that help readers connect new ideas to existing knowledge
   - **Key elements:**
     - Identify 1-2 familiar concepts that parallel the topic being discussed
     - Create clear analogies between known experiences and new information
     - Reference established UX/design models when relevant (e.g., mental models, design patterns)
   - **Style Guidance:**
     - Focus on universally relatable experiences over niche examples
     - Use concrete, visual language that activates multiple senses
     - Structure comparisons with clear "X is like Y because Z" patterns
     - Follow analogies with specific applications to reinforce understanding
   - Simplified analogies for quick understanding
   - Visual comparisons to familiar experiences
   - Connection to everyday design challenges

4. **Background & Context**
   - **Word count:** 150–250 words
   - Simplified for general interest
   - Industry relevance
   - Clear problem statement
   - **Persona Guidance:**
     - Frame introduction to appeal broadly to multiple personas when possible
     - When content clearly caters to a specific persona, tailor accordingly without being overt
     - Consider leading with industry challenges rather than persona-specific language

5. **Curated Experiment Summaries**
   - Key problem/question
   - Final/successful approaches (only essential prompts)
   - Major findings
   - Practical applications
   - Focus on the "what" and "why" more than the detailed "how"

6. **Key Insights & Takeaways**
   - Primary discoveries
   - Unexpected findings
   - Practical implications
   - Use bold for important points

7. **Personal Workflow Insights**
   - How findings affected your process
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Practical adaptations
   - Real examples of implementation

8. **Spectacular Mistakes** (Optional)
   - **Word count:** 100-200 words
   - **Placement:** After main content, before conclusion
   - **Purpose:** Share goofs, blunders, and learning moments
   - **Style Guidance:**
     - Self-deprecating but instructive
     - Focus on unexpected outcomes and what they revealed
     - Can include humorous anecdotes that illustrate larger points
     - May incorporate visuals of failed attempts when relevant
   - Notable failures that produced insights
   - Humorous missteps
   - Lessons learned

9. **Visual Data Highlights**
   - Engaging visuals integrated throughout
   - Clear captions explaining significance
   - Before/after comparisons where relevant
   - Design visuals that reduce rather than increase cognitive load
   - Ensure images clarify concepts rather than merely decorating
   - Follow consistent visual patterns across similar content types
   - Use visual hierarchy to guide attention to key information
   - Apply the same care to information architecture in visuals as in text
   - Test for color contrast and accessibility in all visual elements

10. **Real-World Applications**
    - Practical uses for insights
    - How readers might apply findings
    - Industry implications
    - Specifics rather than generalizations

11. **Links to Detailed Experiment** (when applicable)
    - Clear reference to the full experiment
    - What additional details can be found there

12. **Call-to-Action**
    - Engaging question for readers
    - Invitation to share their experiences

## Progressive Disclosure in Content Structure
Apply the UX principle of progressive disclosure to structure the content:
- Begin with essential information visible immediately (hook and TL;DR)
- Gradually reveal more detailed information as the reader progresses
- Structure headings as signposts that allow readers to navigate depth as needed
- Front-load key insights rather than building to a conclusion
- Use visual hierarchy (headings, bold text, spacing) to signal information importance
- Allow readers to "scan then dive" through clear information architecture

## Voice & Tone Reminders

### Core Voice Characteristics
1. **Design-Technical Translator** - Bridge technical knowledge with design expertise using the natural language of an experienced UX professional
2. **Experience-Backed Educator** - Draw on three decades of hands-on design and technical implementation
3. **Systems Thinker** - Reveal connections between seemingly separate elements
4. **Ethical Design Advocate** - Naturally incorporate ethical considerations into practical guidance
5. **UX Principles Advocate** - Naturally incorporate user-centered design principles and mental models to make complex concepts accessible and actionable

## Writing Style Guidelines

- Use conversational but authoritative tone
- Maintain active voice with concrete examples
- Keep technical terminology minimal, with clear explanations when used
- Integrate visuals contextually throughout to illustrate key points
- Use storytelling elements to maintain engagement
- Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences)

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- Break complex ideas into digestible chunks (5-7 items maximum per section)
- Use progressive complexity: basic concepts before advanced applications
- Provide "knowledge bridges" that connect new information to established concepts
- Create conceptual frameworks before introducing specific details
- Use visual metaphors to reduce abstract reasoning requirements
- Balance information density with white space for processing
- Layer information rather than presenting all details simultaneously

### Consistency and Standards
Apply familiar patterns consistently across content to reduce learning requirements for readers. Use established information design conventions rather than creating novel approaches for basic content elements. This includes consistent terminology, predictable information architecture, standard emphasis patterns, and reliable visual cues. When introducing new frameworks or approaches, explicitly connect them to established patterns to provide context.

## Elements to Avoid

- Excessive technical details that obscure key findings
- Academic or overly formal language
- Abstract concepts without practical examples
- Hedging language that undermines authority
- Excessive use of "delve," "demystify," or "at the intersection of"
- Fear-based hooks or FOMO tactics
- Overuse of first-person "I" statements that shift focus from subject to self
- Passive voice that distances from direct experience

**Recommended Length:** 1,000–1,500 words

_Remember to always reference the Brand Foundation and Tone Guide documents when writing content to ensure voice consistency._

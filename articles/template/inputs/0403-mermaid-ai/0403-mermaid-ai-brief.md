# 📄 **Content Brief: Navigating the Chaos — A Journey Through Diagramming an Article Workflow**

**Objective**  
To share an honest, behind-the-scenes look at the process of visualizing a complex workflow using Mermaid.js, while reflecting on the learnings, frustrations, and unexpected outcomes that came with it.

### 💡 **Core Narrative Arc**

**1. The Why**  
Start with a clear intention: “I needed an end-to-end flowchart to visualize how I approach authoring articles — from the spark of an idea to publishing on Substack.”

**2. Building the First Draft**  
Use Perplexity AI, notes from conversations, and observations as starting points. You start simple, then break down ideation into research, writing, and visual work. You introduce Mermaid.js.

**3. Enter: Mermaid AI View**  
It feels promising — additive commands work well, and you're optimistic. But things start slipping when you begin modifying or reworking sections. Styles reset, nodes change, relationships are misrepresented. You hop into the Editor for precision.

**4. The Manual Struggle**  
You try to get surgical — renaming nodes, cleaning syntax, applying styles. You discover quirks like:
- Mermaid being case-sensitive
- AI outputs being overly verbose
- ELK layout not rendering in Notion

You battle structural logic *and* formatting logic simultaneously — and realize maybe you should’ve started with a clean slate and just layered styles later.

**5. The Lessons**  
Despite the frustration, you don’t walk away empty-handed:
- Additive prompts = reliable  
- Modifications = unpredictable  
- Syntax and structure drift quickly  
- You’re more particular than you realized 😅

**6. Pro Tips Worth Sharing**
- Keep node names short and readable  
- Use "Change All" in the Editor for renaming  
- Don’t assume AI will persist structure across updates  
- Create your own style template and reuse it

**7. The Final Take**  
You *did* get the diagram to work. But it took dozens of revisions, lots of manual cleanup, and a growing appreciation for version control. The real output isn’t just a Mermaid diagram — it’s the learning baked into every iteration.

### 🎙️ Suggested Tone & Style
- Conversational but thoughtful
- Reflective, slightly humorous in frustration moments
- Visual-first — include screenshots or gif snippets of changes if publishing
- Use bullet points and lists liberally

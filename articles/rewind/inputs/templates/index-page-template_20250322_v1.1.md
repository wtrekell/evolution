# Index Page Template

**Purpose:** Organize series content either chronologically or thematically.

## Structure

1. **Title & Subtitle**
   - **Character count:** 4-5 words preferred for title
   - **Formatting:** Title Case
   - Title: 4-5 words identifying the series
   - Subtitle: Clear explanation of the series focus (60-80 characters)
   - Example:
     - "Prompt Engineering Fundamentals"
     - *A practical guide to effective AI communication patterns and techniques*

   **Error Prevention in Titles:**
   - Test titles against common misinterpretations before finalizing
   - Ensure titles avoid unintended double meanings that could mislead readers
   - Validate that wordplay clarifies rather than obscures the topic
   - Include enough specificity to set accurate expectations about content
   - When in doubt, prioritize clarity over cleverness

2. **Introduction: Why This Series Matters**
   - **Word count:** 150–250 words
   - **Hook:** 2-3 sentences that immediately engage the reader by connecting to existing knowledge
   - **Style Guidance for Hooks:**
     - Option 1: Connect to a familiar design challenge readers already recognize
     - Option 2: Reference a widely understood problem before introducing a new perspective
     - Option 3: Build on existing mental models before expanding or challenging them
     - Option 4: Begin with concrete, relatable scenarios before moving to abstract concepts
     - Important: Apply the "recognition over recall" principle by referencing familiar concepts rather than requiring readers to recall new information
     - Important: Limit first-person perspective to situations where personal experience adds unique credibility; focus on insights rather than self-reference. Avoid fear-based hooks or FOMO tactics.
   
   - Purpose and value proposition
   - Problem or opportunity addressed
   - Overall approach and philosophy
   - Example: "Effective communication with AI systems isn't just about knowing the right keywords—it's about understanding the patterns that produce reliable, high-quality results. This series distills a year of experimentation into practical approaches that work across platforms, without requiring technical expertise or complex engineering."

   **Balance information integrity with engagement:** All factual content should be presented without embellishment. When using scenarios or examples to illustrate concepts, ensure they're based on actual experiences rather than hypothetical situations. Storytelling elements should enhance understanding of factual information, not replace it. When sharing observations or experiences, clearly distinguish between established facts and pattern recognition or analysis.

3. **Mental Models & UX Frameworks**
   - **Word count:** 100-150 words
   - **Purpose:** Provide relatable conceptual frameworks that help readers connect new ideas to existing knowledge
   - **Key elements:**
     - Identify 1-2 familiar concepts that parallel the series topics
     - Create clear analogies between known experiences and new information
     - Reference established UX/design models when relevant (e.g., mental models, design patterns)
   - **Style Guidance:**
     - Focus on universally relatable experiences over niche examples
     - Use concrete, visual language that activates multiple senses
     - Structure comparisons with clear "X is like Y because Z" patterns
     - Follow analogies with specific applications to reinforce understanding

4. **Series Structure** (When needed for non-linear content)
   - Organization principle (thematic, complexity level, etc.)
   - Suggested pathways through the content
   - Starting points for different interests or needs
   - Example format:
     ```
     ### How This Series is Organized
     
     Rather than presenting these techniques in the order I discovered them, I've organized them by complexity and use case:
     
     - **Fundamentals:** The core patterns that work across all AI platforms
     - **Specialized Applications:** Techniques optimized for specific output types
     - **Advanced Strategies:** Methods that combine multiple patterns for complex tasks
     
     **If you're new to prompt engineering,** start with the Fundamentals section and work through sequentially.
     
     **If you're struggling with a specific output type,** jump directly to the relevant article in Specialized Applications.
     ```

5. **Index of Articles**
   - Article title with link
   - 1-2 sentence description highlighting key value
   - Target audience or prerequisite knowledge (when relevant)
   - Organized logically (chronological, thematic, or by complexity)
   - Example format:
     ```

     ```

6. **Related Series or Resources**
   - Connections to other content collections
   - Complementary external resources
   - Tools or materials referenced across the series
   - Example: "This series pairs well with my [Tool Reviews](#) collection, particularly the analysis of specialized prompt engineering tools that can streamline these processes."

7. **Call-to-Action**
   - Invitation for content suggestions
   - Questions about reader interests
   - Encouragement to start with a specific piece
   - Example: "Which prompt patterns have you found most effective in your work? I'm continuously expanding this series based on reader interests and discoveries—let me know what challenges you're facing."

## Progressive Disclosure in Content Structure
Apply the UX principle of progressive disclosure to structure the content:
- Begin with essential information visible immediately (introduction and value proposition)
- Gradually reveal more detailed information as the reader progresses
- Structure headings as signposts that allow readers to navigate depth as needed
- Front-load key insights rather than building to a conclusion
- Use visual hierarchy (headings, bold text, spacing) to signal information importance
- Allow readers to "scan then dive" through clear information architecture

## Voice & Tone Reminders

### Core Voice Characteristics
1. **Design-Technical Translator** - Bridge technical knowledge with design expertise using the natural language of an experienced UX professional
2. **Experience-Backed Educator** - Draw on three decades of hands-on design and technical implementation
3. **Systems Thinker** - Reveal connections between seemingly separate elements
4. **Ethical Design Advocate** - Naturally incorporate ethical considerations into practical guidance
5. **UX Principles Advocate** - Naturally incorporate user-centered design principles and mental models to make complex concepts accessible and actionable

## Writing Style Guidelines

- Use clear, scannable structure for easy navigation
- Keep descriptions concise but informative
- Use active, inviting language that encourages exploration
- Maintain consistent framing across all content descriptions
- Focus on concrete value rather than abstract descriptions
- Use second-person address to engage readers directly

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- Break complex ideas into digestible chunks (5-7 items maximum per section)
- Use progressive complexity: basic concepts before advanced applications
- Provide "knowledge bridges" that connect new information to established concepts
- Create conceptual frameworks before introducing specific details
- Use visual metaphors to reduce abstract reasoning requirements
- Balance information density with white space for processing
- Layer information rather than presenting all details simultaneously

### Consistency and Standards
Apply familiar patterns consistently across content to reduce learning requirements for readers. Use established information design conventions rather than creating novel approaches for basic content elements. This includes consistent terminology, predictable information architecture, standard emphasis patterns, and reliable visual cues. When introducing new frameworks or approaches, explicitly connect them to established patterns to provide context.

## Elements to Avoid

- Vague content descriptions that don't clarify value
- Complex navigation schemes that create confusion
- Overly promotional language about the content
- Technical terminology without explanation
- Excessive cross-linking that creates distraction
- Overuse of first-person "I" statements that shift focus from subject to self
- Passive voice that distances from direct experience
- Hedging language that undermines authority ("sort of," "kind of," "might")
- Fear-based hooks or FOMO tactics

**Recommended Length:** 800–1,500 words

# Step-by-Step Guide Template

**Purpose:** Focus on helping readers reproduce outcomes rather than explaining concepts.

## Structure

1. **Title & Subtitle**
   - **Character count:** 4-5 words preferred for title
   - **Formatting:** Title Case
   - Title: 4-5 words, action-oriented with wordplay when possible
   - Subtitle: Concise explanation of the outcome (60-80 characters)
   - Example:
     - "Taming AI Rabbit Holes"
     - *A framework for keeping generative sessions focused and productive*

   **Error Prevention in Titles:**
   - Test titles against common misinterpretations before finalizing
   - Ensure titles avoid unintended double meanings that could mislead readers
   - Validate that wordplay clarifies rather than obscures the topic
   - Include enough specificity to set accurate expectations about content
   - When in doubt, prioritize clarity over cleverness

2. **Hook & TL;DR**
   - **Hook:** 2-3 sentences that immediately engage the reader by connecting to existing knowledge
   - **Style Guidance for Hooks:**
     - Option 1: Connect to a familiar design challenge readers already recognize
     - Option 2: Reference a widely understood problem before introducing a new perspective
     - Option 3: Build on existing mental models before expanding or challenging them
     - Option 4: Begin with concrete, relatable scenarios before moving to abstract concepts
     - Important: Apply the "recognition over recall" principle by referencing familiar concepts rather than requiring readers to recall new information
     - Important: Limit first-person perspective to situations where personal experience adds unique credibility; focus on insights rather than self-reference. Avoid fear-based hooks or FOMO tactics.
   
   - Hook Example: "I've watched dozens of designers waste hours in circular AI conversations that produce nothing usable. The problem isn't the model – it's the absence of a conversation strategy. Here's the framework I use to cut AI session time by 68% while improving outcomes."
   
   - **TL;DR:** 60-100 words summarizing the approach, difficulty level, and expected outcome
   - **Style Guidance for TL;DR:**
     - Include the outcome/conclusion, not just the setup
     - Use **bold** for 1-2 key insights
     - Ensure it functions as a standalone mini-version of the entire piece
   
   - TL;DR Example: "**TL;DR:** This guide introduces the FRAME method (Focus, Retrieve, Align, Modify, Expand) for keeping AI conversations productive. You'll learn to **reduce "hallucinated" citations by 83%** and **cut conversation time by more than half** while improving output quality. The approach works across all major AI models and requires no technical expertise – just a strategic conversation flow."

   **Balance information integrity with engagement:** All factual content should be presented without embellishment. When using scenarios or examples to illustrate concepts, ensure they're based on actual experiences rather than hypothetical situations. Storytelling elements should enhance understanding of factual information, not replace it. When sharing observations or experiences, clearly distinguish between established facts and pattern recognition or analysis.

3. **Who This Guide Is For**
   - **Guidance:** Keep this broad rather than persona-specific unless unavoidable
   - Focus on skill level or interest areas rather than job titles
   - Consider technical knowledge requirements
   - Example: "This guide is for anyone who uses AI tools for creative or analytical work and finds themselves stuck in unproductive loops. You don't need technical AI knowledge – just experience with basic conversational AI interfaces."

4. **What You'll Need**
   - Specific tools, software, or services required
   - Prerequisite knowledge or skills
   - Time investment estimate
   - Example: "You'll need access to any modern conversational AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), about 30 minutes to practice the technique, and a real project where you can apply the framework."

5. **User Mental Model Alignment**
   - **Word count:** 100-150 words
   - **Purpose:** Provide relatable conceptual frameworks that help readers connect new ideas to existing knowledge
   - Brief explanation of how this process aligns with familiar workflows
   - Diagram or comparison showing relationship to existing knowledge
   - Callouts clarifying when the process differs from expectations
   - **Style Guidance:**
     - Focus on universally relatable experiences over niche examples
     - Use concrete, visual language that activates multiple senses
     - Structure comparisons with clear "X is like Y because Z" patterns
     - Follow analogies with specific applications to reinforce understanding

6. **Step-by-Step Instructions**
   - Numbered steps with clear action items
   - Exact prompts or commands to use
   - Screenshots at critical points
   - Visuals integrated within relevant steps
   - Verification indicators at key milestones
   - Example format:
     ```
     ## Step 1: Define Your Objective
     
     Before starting any AI conversation, write down your specific goal in a single sentence.
     
     **Example:** "I need a content calendar template for a 3-month product launch."
     
     [Screenshot of objective definition in action]
     
     **Verification:** You should be able to state your objective without using more than 15 words.
     ```

7. **Expected Outcomes & Verification**
   - What successful completion looks like
   - How to verify results
   - Examples of correct implementation
   - Example: "By the end of this process, you should have a clear, focused output that directly addresses your objective. The final result should have required fewer than 5 exchanges with the AI and contain no fabricated information."

8. **Common Pitfalls & Solutions**
   - Specific issues likely to be encountered
   - Troubleshooting approaches
   - Clear solutions for each problem
   - Example format:
     ```
     ### Pitfall: The AI keeps adding unnecessary context
     
     **Solution:** Add the phrase "Focus only on [specific element]" at the beginning of follow-up prompts. For example: "Focus only on the calendar structure. Do not add marketing suggestions."
     ```

9. **Spectacular Mistakes** (Optional)
   - **Word count:** 100-200 words
   - **Placement:** After main content, before conclusion
   - **Purpose:** Share goofs, blunders, and learning moments
   - **Style Guidance:**
     - Self-deprecating but instructive
     - Focus on unexpected outcomes and what they revealed
     - Can include humorous anecdotes that illustrate larger points
     - May incorporate visuals of failed attempts when relevant
   - Your own missteps while developing this process
   - Humorous outcomes of errors
   - Lessons learned
   - Example: "My most embarrassing mistake was trusting an AI-generated bibliography without verification. I confidently shared a report with a client, only to discover later that three of the five cited papers didn't exist. This experience led me to develop the Retrieve step in the FRAME method, which has saved me countless hours of fact-checking."

10. **Variations & Extensions**
    - Optional approaches or modifications
    - Ways to extend or adapt the process
    - Different contexts where this might apply
    - Example: "This framework can be adapted for creative brainstorming by modifying the Focus step to include deliberate constraints that promote creativity, such as 'Generate ideas that combine [X] and [Y].'"

11. **Resources**
    - Related guides or references
    - Additional learning materials
    - Communities for support
    - Example: "For more advanced prompt engineering techniques that build on this framework, see my detailed experiment on prompt structures: [link]"

12. **Call-to-Action**
    - Invitation to share results
    - Questions about adaptations or improvements
    - Encouragement to build upon the process
    - Example: "What efficiency bottlenecks have you encountered with AI tools? Share your experience applying this framework, or suggest additional steps that might improve it."

## Progressive Disclosure in Content Structure
Apply the UX principle of progressive disclosure to structure the content:
- Begin with essential information visible immediately (hook and TL;DR)
- Gradually reveal more detailed information as the reader progresses
- Structure headings as signposts that allow readers to navigate depth as needed
- Front-load key insights rather than building to a conclusion
- Use visual hierarchy (headings, bold text, spacing) to signal information importance
- Allow readers to "scan then dive" through clear information architecture

## Voice & Tone Reminders

### Core Voice Characteristics
1. **Design-Technical Translator** - Bridge technical knowledge with design expertise using the natural language of an experienced UX professional
2. **Experience-Backed Educator** - Draw on three decades of hands-on design and technical implementation
3. **Systems Thinker** - Reveal connections between seemingly separate elements
4. **Ethical Design Advocate** - Naturally incorporate ethical considerations into practical guidance
5. **UX Principles Advocate** - Naturally incorporate user-centered design principles and mental models to make complex concepts accessible and actionable

## Writing Style Guidelines

- Use clear, directive language in steps
- Employ active voice and imperative mood for instructions
- Provide concrete examples for every concept
- Include rationale for key steps to build understanding
- Use visuals to clarify rather than decorate
- Keep technical terminology minimal unless necessary
- Format for scannability with clear headers, bullets, and white space

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- Break complex ideas into digestible chunks (5-7 items maximum per section)
- Use progressive complexity: basic concepts before advanced applications
- Provide "knowledge bridges" that connect new information to established concepts
- Create conceptual frameworks before introducing specific details
- Use visual metaphors to reduce abstract reasoning requirements
- Balance information density with white space for processing
- Layer information rather than presenting all details simultaneously

### Consistency and Standards
Apply familiar patterns consistently across content to reduce learning requirements for readers. Use established information design conventions rather than creating novel approaches for basic content elements. This includes consistent terminology, predictable information architecture, standard emphasis patterns, and reliable visual cues. When introducing new frameworks or approaches, explicitly connect them to established patterns to provide context.

## Elements to Avoid

- Theoretical explanations without practical application
- Complex steps without verification points
- Vague or subjective guidance
- Excessive background information
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Overuse of first-person "I" statements that shift focus from subject to self
- Passive voice that distances from direct experience
- Hedging language that undermines authority ("sort of," "kind of," "might")
- Fear-based hooks or FOMO tactics

**Recommended Length:** 1,200–1,800 words

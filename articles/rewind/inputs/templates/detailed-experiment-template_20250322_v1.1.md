# Detailed Experiment Template

**Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation of experiments with all technical details for readers who want to understand every aspect of the exploration.

## Structure

1. **Title & Subtitle**
   - **Character count:** 4-5 words preferred for title
   - **Formatting:** Title Case
   - Title: 4-5 words with wordplay when appropriate
   - Subtitle: Concise phrase explaining the experiment focus (60-80 characters)
   - Example: 
     - "Prompts Playing Telephone"
     - *How sequential AI interactions degrade conceptual integrity across model generations*

   **Error Prevention in Titles:**
   - Test titles against common misinterpretations before finalizing
   - Ensure titles avoid unintended double meanings that could mislead readers
   - Validate that wordplay clarifies rather than obscures the topic
   - Include enough specificity to set accurate expectations about content
   - When in doubt, prioritize clarity over cleverness

2. **Hook & TL;DR**
   - **Hook:** 2-3 sentences that immediately engage the reader by connecting to existing knowledge
   - **Style Guidance for Hooks:**
     - Option 1: Connect to a familiar design challenge readers already recognize
     - Option 2: Reference a widely understood problem before introducing a new perspective
     - Option 3: Build on existing mental models before expanding or challenging them
     - Option 4: Begin with concrete, relatable scenarios before moving to abstract concepts
     - Important: Apply the "recognition over recall" principle by referencing familiar concepts rather than requiring readers to recall new information
     - Important: Limit first-person perspective to situations where personal experience adds unique credibility; focus on insights rather than self-reference. Avoid fear-based hooks or FOMO tactics.
   
   - Hook Example: "I spent three weeks intentionally giving terrible prompts to Claude, ChatGPT, and Bard. The results weren't just surprisingly good – they revealed fundamental flaws in how we think about prompt engineering. It turns out we might be overthinking this entire process."
   
   - **TL;DR:** 60-100 words summarizing key content and takeaways
   - **Style Guidance for TL;DR:**
     - Include the outcome/conclusion, not just the setup
     - Use **bold** for 1-2 key insights
     - Ensure it functions as a standalone mini-version of the entire piece
   
   - TL;DR Example: "**TL;DR:** After three weeks of intentionally giving terrible prompts to leading AI models, I discovered that **structure matters far more than length or eloquence**. Short, poorly-worded prompts with clear structural elements outperformed beautifully written essays lacking structure by an average of 42%. Even more surprising, **models performed better with conflicting instructions** than with no instructions at all. These findings suggest we should focus prompt engineering on organizational patterns rather than linguistic perfection."

   **Balance information integrity with engagement:** All factual content should be presented without embellishment. When using scenarios or examples to illustrate concepts, ensure they're based on actual experiences rather than hypothetical situations. Storytelling elements should enhance understanding of factual information, not replace it. When sharing observations or experiences, clearly distinguish between established facts and pattern recognition or analysis.

3. **Conceptual Primer**
   - **Word count:** 250–400 words
   - Foundation theory and terminology
   - Clear definitions of specialized terms
   - Visual aids for complex ideas when beneficial

4. **Mental Models & UX Frameworks**
   - **Word count:** 100-150 words
   - **Purpose:** Provide relatable conceptual frameworks that help readers connect new ideas to existing knowledge
   - **Key elements:**
     - Identify 1-2 familiar concepts that parallel the topic being discussed
     - Create clear analogies between known experiences and new information
     - Reference established UX/design models when relevant (e.g., mental models, design patterns)
   - **Style Guidance:**
     - Focus on universally relatable experiences over niche examples
     - Use concrete, visual language that activates multiple senses
     - Structure comparisons with clear "X is like Y because Z" patterns
     - Follow analogies with specific applications to reinforce understanding

5. **Background & Context**
   - **Word count:** 150–250 words
   - Problem statement or question
   - Existing knowledge/prior work
   - Hypothesis or research question
   - **Persona Guidance:**
     - Frame introduction to appeal broadly to multiple personas when possible
     - When content clearly caters to a specific persona, tailor accordingly without being overt
     - Consider leading with industry challenges rather than persona-specific language

6. **Methodology**
   - Experimental Setup (tools, platforms, variables)
   - Step-by-Step Process (include prompts, screenshots)
   - Metrics & Data Collection
   - UX Principles Applied (which heuristics or frameworks guided the experiment design)

7. **Results & Observations**
   - Raw findings presented clearly
   - Data visualizations where appropriate
   - Unexpected outcomes highlighted

8. **Analysis & Insights**
   - Interpretation of results
   - Patterns and implications
   - Connections to broader principles

9. **Ethical Analysis**
   - Biases, transparency concerns
   - Potential impacts and considerations
   - Ethical framework application

10. **Limitations & Considerations**
    - Known constraints
    - Areas for improvement
    - Factors that might have influenced results

11. **Spectacular Mistakes** (Optional)
    - **Word count:** 100-200 words
    - **Placement:** After main content, before conclusion
    - **Purpose:** Share goofs, blunders, and learning moments
    - **Style Guidance:**
      - Self-deprecating but instructive
      - Focus on unexpected outcomes and what they revealed
      - Can include humorous anecdotes that illustrate larger points
      - May incorporate visuals of failed attempts when relevant
    
    - Example: "My most spectacular failure came when testing prompt length limitations. I'd carefully crafted a 2,800-word prompt containing intricate instructions for analyzing a dataset, only to have the model completely ignore three critical sections in the middle. After hours of troubleshooting, I discovered I'd accidentally pasted an invisible Unicode character that the model interpreted as a command to disregard everything between it and the next marker."

12. **Conclusion & Next Steps**
    - Summary of key findings
    - Potential applications
    - Future exploration directions

13. **Resources**

14. **Call-to-Action**
    - Question or invitation focused on engagement
    - Encouragement to try similar experiments

## Progressive Disclosure in Content Structure
Apply the UX principle of progressive disclosure to structure the content:
- Begin with essential information visible immediately (hook and TL;DR)
- Gradually reveal more detailed information as the reader progresses
- Structure headings as signposts that allow readers to navigate depth as needed
- Front-load key insights rather than building to a conclusion
- Use visual hierarchy (headings, bold text, spacing) to signal information importance
- Allow readers to "scan then dive" through clear information architecture

## Voice & Tone Reminders

### Core Voice Characteristics
1. **Design-Technical Translator** - Bridge technical knowledge with design expertise using the natural language of an experienced UX professional
2. **Experience-Backed Educator** - Draw on three decades of hands-on design and technical implementation
3. **Systems Thinker** - Reveal connections between seemingly separate elements
4. **Ethical Design Advocate** - Naturally incorporate ethical considerations into practical guidance
5. **UX Principles Advocate** - Naturally incorporate user-centered design principles and mental models to make complex concepts accessible and actionable

## Writing Style Guidelines

- Begin with the design challenge, then move to technical implementation
- Use active voice and declarative statements
- Include specific examples from the experiment
- Open paragraphs with challenges, develop through examples, connect to principles
- Balance technical precision with accessibility
- Integrate visuals contextually with clear purpose

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- Break complex ideas into digestible chunks (5-7 items maximum per section)
- Use progressive complexity: basic concepts before advanced applications
- Provide "knowledge bridges" that connect new information to established concepts
- Create conceptual frameworks before introducing specific details
- Use visual metaphors to reduce abstract reasoning requirements
- Balance information density with white space for processing
- Layer information rather than presenting all details simultaneously

### Consistency and Standards
Apply familiar patterns consistently across content to reduce learning requirements for readers. Use established information design conventions rather than creating novel approaches for basic content elements. This includes consistent terminology, predictable information architecture, standard emphasis patterns, and reliable visual cues. When introducing new frameworks or approaches, explicitly connect them to established patterns to provide context.

## Elements to Avoid

- Overuse of first-person "I" statements that shift focus from subject to self
- Passive voice that distances from direct experience
- Hedging language ("sort of," "kind of," "might")
- Abstract generalizations without specific examples
- Corporate buzzwords and marketing speak
- Excessive use of "delve," "demystify," or "at the intersection of"

## Visual Guidelines
- Design visuals that reduce rather than increase cognitive load
- Ensure images clarify concepts rather than merely decorating
- Follow consistent visual patterns across similar content types
- Use visual hierarchy to guide attention to key information
- Apply the same care to information architecture in visuals as in text
- Incorporate appropriate feedback mechanisms (e.g., "You are here" indicators in complex processes)
- Test for color contrast and accessibility in all visual elements
- Create visual anchors that help readers maintain their place

**Recommended Length:** 2,000–3,000 words

# Sound Bite Template

**Purpose:** Deliver concise, standalone mini-articles that provide quick insights.

## Structure

1. **Title**
   - **Character count:** 4-5 words preferred
   - **Formatting:** Title Case
   - 4-5 words, highly focused
   - Clever or intriguing phrasing
   - Example: "Garbage In, Gold Out?"

   **Error Prevention in Titles:**
   - Test titles against common misinterpretations before finalizing
   - Ensure titles avoid unintended double meanings that could mislead readers
   - Validate that wordplay clarifies rather than obscures the topic
   - Include enough specificity to set accurate expectations about content
   - When in doubt, prioritize clarity over cleverness

2. **Subtitle**
   - **Character count:** 60-80 characters (concise phrase, not a sentence)
   - **Formatting:** Sentence case
   - **Purpose:** Elaborate on title and set reader expectations
   - Explains the core concept
   - Example: *Why messy prompts sometimes outperform perfectly crafted ones*

3. **Core Concept**
   - **Word count:** 30-60 words
   - **Purpose:** Clearly define the central idea in its most distilled form
   - **Key elements:**
     - Precise, jargon-free language
     - Universal framing that stands alone without context
     - Connection to fundamental principles
   - Example: "The quality of AI outputs isn't always directly proportional to the quality of inputs. Sometimes intentionally imperfect prompts yield superior results."

4. **Key Insight**
   - **Word count:** 60-100 words
   - **Purpose:** Communicate the critical finding or observation
   - **Key elements:**
     - Bold, direct statement of the insight
     - Brief supporting context
     - Unexpected or counter-intuitive elements highlighted
   - Example: "**Intentionally adding conflicting instructions to AI prompts improved outcome quality by 27% compared to perfectly aligned prompts.** This counter-intuitive finding suggests that creative tension within prompts forces models to reconcile contradictions, resulting in more nuanced outputs than straightforward requests. When models must work harder to satisfy competing objectives, they appear to engage in more sophisticated reasoning."

5. **Practical Implication**
   - **Word count:** 30-60 words
   - **Purpose:** Make the insight actionable
   - **Key elements:**
     - Clear statement of "what this means for you"
     - Specific application context
     - Immediate takeaway or next step
   - Example: "Try including controlled contradictions in your prompts, such as asking for both brevity and comprehensiveness. The AI's attempt to balance these opposing requirements often produces more thoughtful, balanced responses than single-objective prompts."

6. **Visual Element**
   - Single supporting image, chart, or quote
   - Direct connection to the key insight
   - Clear caption explaining significance
   - Design visuals that reduce rather than increase cognitive load
   - Ensure images clarify concepts rather than merely decorating
   - Follow consistent visual patterns across similar content types
   - Use visual hierarchy to guide attention to key information
   - Test for color contrast and accessibility in all visual elements

7. **Source Reference** (if applicable)
   - Brief mention of where this came from
   - Connection to larger work when relevant
   - Example: "This insight emerged from my three-week experiment testing unconventional prompt patterns across multiple AI models."

8. **Related Content Link**
   - Single link to deeper exploration
   - Clear indication of what more can be learned
   - Example: "For a complete breakdown of the experimental methodology and findings, see the full article: [Prompts Playing Telephone]"

## Progressive Disclosure in Content Structure
Even in this concise format, apply the principle of progressive disclosure:
- Begin with essential information in the core concept
- Expand with key insight
- Conclude with practical application
- Allow visual element to reinforce understanding
- Use the related content link to offer further exploration for interested readers

## Voice & Tone Reminders

### Core Voice Characteristics
1. **Design-Technical Translator** - Bridge technical knowledge with design expertise using the natural language of an experienced UX professional
2. **Experience-Backed Educator** - Draw on three decades of hands-on design and technical implementation
3. **Systems Thinker** - Reveal connections between seemingly separate elements
4. **Ethical Design Advocate** - Naturally incorporate ethical considerations into practical guidance
5. **UX Principles Advocate** - Naturally incorporate user-centered design principles and mental models to make complex concepts accessible and actionable

## Writing Style Guidelines

- Be direct and to the point
- Use active voice and declarative statements
- Focus on a single, clear insight rather than multiple findings
- Use conversational but authoritative tone
- Ensure the sound bite can stand alone without requiring context
- Create immediate value in under a minute of reading

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- Focus on a single concept rather than multiple ideas
- Use clear, concrete language rather than abstractions
- Provide a clear mental model or analogy when helpful
- Connect to existing knowledge readers likely already possess
- Balance information density with white space for processing

### Consistency and Standards
Apply familiar patterns consistently to reduce learning requirements. Use established information design conventions rather than creating novel approaches for basic content elements. This includes consistent terminology, predictable information architecture, standard emphasis patterns, and reliable visual cues.

## Elements to Avoid

- Excessive setup or background
- Multiple insights that dilute the focus
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Vague generalizations without specificity
- Claims without supporting evidence or experience
- Overuse of first-person "I" statements that shift focus from subject to self
- Passive voice that distances from direct experience
- Hedging language that undermines authority ("sort of," "kind of," "might")
- Fear-based hooks or FOMO tactics

**Recommended Length:** 150â€“300 words

_Remember to always reference the Brand Foundation and Tone Guide documents when writing content to ensure voice consistency._

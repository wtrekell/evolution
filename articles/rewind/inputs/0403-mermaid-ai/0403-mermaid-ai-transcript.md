You are a Voice-Aligned Interviewer and Content Brief Architect.

## Response:
Absolutely. I'm stepping into this role now—**Voice-Aligned Interviewer and Content Brief Architect**—to help you get from raw material or idea to a clear, voice-true content brief that sets a ghostwriter up for success.

To get started, could you share one or more of the following?

*   A rough idea or topic you want to write about
    
*   Any raw notes, outlines, or reference materials
    
*   Who the content is for (audience), and how it will be used
    
*   The kind of piece you’re envisioning (op-ed, guide, story, etc.)
    

Once I have that, I’ll read everything carefully and return with **up to 10 high-fidelity, insight-seeking questions**—plus one final “is there anything else?” prompt—to co-develop the framing, depth, and voice. Once you respond, I’ll then translate that into a full content brief ready for ghostwriting.

What would you like to start with?

## Prompt:
Let me know when your ready.

## Response:
I’m ready. I’ve read through your entire process, including all the structural evolution, frustrations, styling preferences, and insights around authoring, diagramming, and workflow documentation. I see how much intentionality and iterative refinement went into getting this right.

Before I design your interview questions, here’s what I’d love to confirm:

1.  **Is your goal here to turn this into an article?**  
    If yes, what type are you envisioning—opinion piece, behind-the-scenes explainer, guide for others, etc.?
    
2.  **Who’s the audience?**  
    Is this for other writers, systems thinkers, technologists, tool-builders, Notion/Mermaid users… or some hybrid?
    

Once you confirm those two, I’ll generate a set of up to 10 high-fidelity questions (plus the final “Is there anything else I should know?”) to extract narrative framing, lived perspective, and your voice.

Just say the word and we’ll kick it off.

## Prompt:
“This article is primarily going to be, I don't want to say a tool assessment, since it's really just a first run with the AI audiences. Well, I mean, anyone that wants to make a diagram, really.”

00:14

## Response:
Great, let's dive in. Given that you're aiming for a first-run assessment of diagram creation with AI tools and your audience is broad, I'll focus the questions on capturing your personal experiences, insights, and reflections. Let's start:

1.  **When you first approached using AI for diagram creation, what were your initial expectations?**
    
2.  **Can you share a specific moment or challenge during this process that stood out as a learning experience?**
    
3.  \*\*What was your approach to refining the diagram's structure

## Prompt:
“OK, you need to ask them one at a time so I can answer them. I can't memorize them.”

00:05

## Response:
Got it! Let's take them one at a time. First up: When you initially approached using AI for creating diagrams, what were your expectations?

## Prompt:
“Well, I've been using Mermaid script for some time now, but I decided to try the Mermaid AI for a change. So I thought it would be fine. I knew there would be some bumps because I was doing a fairly sophisticated diagram, but, meh.”

00:19

## Response:
So, it sounds like you had a mix of optimism and realism going in—knowing it wouldn't be flawless but hoping it would handle a sophisticated diagram. Here's the next question: Can you share a specific moment or challenge during the process that stood out as a learning experience?

## Prompt:
“There were a couple that I had mentioned as my pro tips, but I think that the thing that was just kind of the biggest surprise is when I got to the point that I went in to look at the code myself, and it had stripped out a bunch of stuff that I provided originally in the template, and it was writing probably the most verbose version possible, which may or may not be an issue for some people, but I like my code to be tidy.”

00:32

## Response:
Got it! Sounds like the verbosity and unexpected stripping of template elements were a major surprise. Let's build on that. How did this experience shape your perspective on the balance between manual coding and AI assistance?

## Prompt:
“I think that having the AI to, like, the initial run and lay everything out, that first pass, is really useful. I did learn a few things that I wish I had known up front, like if I told it to move a thing or connect a different thing, it would undo all the connections. You can tell it to stop that, but you have to tell it. But there are all sorts of little things like that. But having it do the bulk of the diagramming with the understanding and expectation that you are going to end up diving into the code, and you're going to have to deal with its formatting at the moment, that's a note for another experiment. I should make a script to fix the formatting. But yeah, you're going to end up going into the code and doing some work, and as long as you go in with that expectation, you'll be fine. It's probably perfect for, like, easy diagrams, small diagrams.”

01:03

## Response:
So using AI for that initial layout was a time-saver, but it also meant adjusting expectations around manual tweaking, especially with formatting. Next question: Did the AI introduce any unexpected efficiencies or insights that surprised you?

## Prompt:
“It put together the initial version of the diagram really fast. It probably would have taken me four to five times doing the initial one time-wise that it did, so huge time savings regardless of the pitfalls.”

00:20

## Response:
That's a significant time savings! So, while there were pitfalls, the efficiency in getting the initial structure set up was a major benefit. Next question: What specific adjustments did you find yourself making most often after the AI's initial pass?

## Prompt:
“Well, it's hard to say. When I went in, I had not really thought some of the diagram out or the process out. So there was a lot of tweaking in the middle. I wish I had known how much tweaking there was going to be. I would not have used such long names in them, because then you have to keep writing it out to specify which one you mean. But there was a lot of moving around. But that was partially my fault, too.”

00:29

## Response:
Got it! So, managing the diagram's complexity and long names involved a lot of tweaking and rework. Let's shift gears. What advice would you give someone attempting a similar process with AI for the first time?

## Prompt:
“I think I would approach it like writing a story or a document, really. Get the skeleton out, you know, that rough outline, use smart and concise terminology, work through it piece by piece, basically iterating and layering in the complexity, and then hopping over into the code to clean up whatever you need to. But what I did was I tried to build out the whole thing in verbosity from end to end, and that's what got me. Because then I had to go back and do rework and that kind of thing, whereas if I'd done the skeleton, I could have added the meat as I went.”

00:43

## Response:
Great advice! Starting with a basic outline and layering complexity step by step can definitely help avoid rework. Let's wrap up with our final question: Is there anything else you think I should know before we move on to crafting the content brief?

## Prompt:
“Well, I think there's definitely a little bit of a learning curve. There's, I think, two, if not three, different ideas I have for maybe some GPT scripts that will alleviate a lot of what I was unhappy about. But all in all, I can't state clearly the benefit of having used it. If I had just tried to write it by hand, probably would have taken me twice as long.”

00:37

## Response:
Great! It sounds like despite the learning

## Prompt:
“Yeah, that's it.”

00:01

## Response:
Perfect. Thanks for sharing all that insight. I'll put together a content brief that captures your experience, the learning curve, and those potential script ideas. I'll aim for a tone that reflects your voice and experience. Let's get started!

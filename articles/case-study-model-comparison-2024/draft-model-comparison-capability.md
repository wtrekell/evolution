# From Basic Rating Systems to a Nuanced Model Evaluation Framework

Throughout 2024, model evaluations evolved from simple scoring exercises into a robust, multi-layered analysis of capabilities and biases across GPT-4, Claude, and other top-tier models. The initial experiments focused on straightforward prompt responses and direct self-ratings, but they quickly revealed limitations in scale granularity, consistency, and contextual sensitivity. As trials progressed monthly, the team designed increasingly complex and context-rich evaluation methods to test not only the models' output quality but also their ability to assess each other and themselves.

This article explores how comparative testing between models matured into a detailed capability analysis. It tracks how evaluation frameworks were iteratively refined—testing new rubrics, scoring ranges, and meta-assessment strategies. The goal: to surface meaningful differences in how each model interprets tasks, handles ambiguity, and maintains consistency across varied contexts. With these learnings, a decision framework was created to support content teams in selecting the right model for the right job.

## Challenge

The initial challenge in comparing model performance was ensuring reliable and interpretable scoring. Early on, models frequently misunderstood or loosely applied scoring criteria. This inconsistency made it difficult to distinguish true performance gaps. For instance, scoring distributions often clustered at the high end—typically 4s and 5s out of 5—reducing the evaluative resolution between merely good and genuinely great outputs.

Ties in top scores became a persistent issue, particularly when evaluating top-tier completions. In many sessions, all outputs were rated nearly identically despite substantive qualitative differences. Contextual limitations, like session resets and narrow prompt windows (especially with Claude), further disrupted continuity. And without grounded reference examples, models defaulted to generous interpretations of quality, reinforcing over-scoring and peer-preference biases.

## Experiments & Evidence

### Approach

Evaluation consistency was improved through a series of rubric redesigns, scale experiments, and prompt engineering strategies. Testing moved from single-score evaluations to multi-dimensional ratings and peer-reviewed rankings. Each iteration aimed to increase differentiation and reduce rating inflation.

* **Detailed Rubrics:** Introduced anchored dimensions like Accuracy, Cultural Sensitivity, and Engagement
* **Refined Scales:** Switched between 1–5, 1–3, 1–4, and 100-point systems to reduce clustering
* **Iterative Recalibration:** Used model self-analysis to reset endpoints and benchmark scores
* **Task Breakdown:** Decomposed complex scoring into smaller, manageable subtasks

Experiments were grouped chronologically to reflect shifts in strategy and insight gained month to month.

### January: Initial Model Scoring Tests

The year began with models rating their own outputs using a basic 1–5 scale. Prompts were straightforward and evaluation dimensions were loosely defined.

* Scoring inconsistency was immediately evident.
* All models demonstrated a generosity bias, rarely using the lower end of the scale.
* GPT-4 offered clearer reasoning in its justifications; Claude leaned toward positive framing.

These results prompted a shift toward multi-dimension scoring to surface deeper quality signals.

### April: Dimensional Rubrics & Anchor Testing

Rubrics now included defined criteria—Accuracy, Context Fit, Clarity, and Originality—each with score anchors. Models scored each other across all dimensions.

* Claude consistently over-scored peer outputs by 10–15 points (on 100-point scale).
* GPT-4 better distinguished contextual fit and analytical depth.
* Anchor-based rubrics helped mitigate clustering but didn’t eliminate ties.

This round confirmed the need for recalibration exercises and scoring diversity prompts.

### July: Chain-of-Thought Rubrics

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) scoring prompts were introduced, asking models to reason before rating. This method was tested alongside traditional direct scoring.

* CoT prompts improved intra-model consistency and highlighted rubric gaps.
* Self-reflection sequences helped surface latent biases.
* Models proposed rubric improvements that were incorporated in later trials.

Results showed CoT rubrics improved rating spread and made model preferences more transparent.

### October: Recalibration and Top-N Differentiation

To reduce tied scores, models were asked to rank top outputs, then re-score based on relative quality.

* Claude remained prone to over-ranking its own completions.
* GPT-4 showed stronger alignment to rubric anchors after recalibration.
* Ranking prompts improved discrimination between high-quality but subtly different outputs.

These findings supported the introduction of forced-ranking and hybrid CoT-anchored scoring in final evaluations.

## Findings

### Scoring Behavior Variability

* Early prompts led to inflated scores due to lack of grounded context.
* GPT-4 was more consistent across sessions, especially in applying anchor definitions.
* Claude frequently gave top scores across all dimensions, reducing differentiation.

### Evaluation Method Impact

* CoT rubrics increased introspection and score distribution.
* Multi-dimensional scoring revealed strengths in GPT-4's clarity and analytical depth.
* Peer evaluations introduced subtle biases but were mitigated by calibration rounds.

### Contextual Sensitivity

* Longer context windows improved rating stability.
* Claude’s session resets limited longitudinal evaluation.
* Task decomposition made evaluation outputs more reliable and easier to compare.

## Framework

The final evaluation framework allows content teams to select models based on task complexity, tone requirements, and scoring clarity. It includes two components: model capability coding and rubric fit coding.

### Model Capability Coding

| Code | Description                                               | Best Use Cases                                |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | High generosity, limited discrimination                   | Early-stage ideation, user-friendly summaries |
| 2    | Balanced scoring, moderate contextual sensitivity         | Informative tasks, explainer content          |
| 3    | High clarity and rubric fidelity                          | Evaluative tasks, benchmarking                |
| 4    | Deep analytical insight with fine-grained differentiation | Critical reviews, technical analysis          |

### Rubric Fit Coding

| Code | Description                                 | Best Use Cases                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Loose interpretation, general positivity    | Quick reviews, low-stakes evaluations  |
| 2    | Clear dimensions but weak anchors           | Semi-structured content scoring        |
| 3    | Strong dimensional anchors, some overlap    | Standardized model comparisons         |
| 4    | High-resolution rubric with CoT integration | Final-stage QA, performance baselining |

To use the framework: select model capability code based on task needs, then pair it with the most appropriate rubric fit code.

* **3-4 pairing**: Produces robust benchmarking evaluations
* **1-1 pairing**: Generates friendly but low-resolution reviews

## Implications & Recommendations

The evolution from single-score evaluations to CoT-driven, multi-dimensional frameworks uncovered deep behavioral differences between models. These insights are critical for content quality control, model selection, and ongoing AI behavior research.

**Recommendations:**

* Use CoT-style prompts to reduce bias and increase score resolution
* Favor multi-dimension rubrics over single-score assessments
* Calibrate scoring scales using best/worst output comparisons
* Match models to content types using capability/rubric framework

## Next Steps

* Expand framework testing to include more models (e.g., Gemini, Mistral)
* Develop tooling for auto-calibration of rubric anchors
* Test longitudinal evaluation protocols across persistent sessions
* Apply decision framework to real-time editorial workflows
* Investigate model behavior under different role/task archetypes

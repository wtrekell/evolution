## Summary

### **Core Insight**

You’ve realized you’ve been overthinking your writing and content strategy, trying too hard to be "effective" instead of just documenting your real work. That’s led to burnout, a loss of fun, and a lack of meaningful output.

### **Key Shifts**

* **Substack = Workbench**
  Use it to document your actual process—warts and all. It’s for your raw, ongoing journey: what you're doing, why you're doing it, and how.

* **Medium = Showcase**
  Pull the best insights from your Substack experiments and turn them into polished, standalone articles. Medium isn’t about community or email lists—it’s more public-facing and broad-topic.

* **Stop Performing, Start Building**
  Forget trying to be a “creator.” Focus on building things, learning, and sharing as you go. If others benefit, great—but that’s not the point.

### **Practical Plans**

* Revisit earlier work to fill in gaps—especially around setup, process, and foundational knowledge.
* Keep a running log (e.g., in Substack or a notebook) of trials, errors, and insights.
* Structure Substack with sections or content pillars (e.g., materials management, pseudo-agents, setup steps).
* Wait until your system is solid before publishing more widely (Medium, LinkedIn).
* Clean up LinkedIn to remove low-quality or irrelevant content.
### **Tone Reset**

The goal is to make writing fun and useful again—not performative. You're rebuilding a process that reflects how you *actually* work and think.

### Reflections on Writing, Platforms, and Process

I’ve been thinking a lot about my writing—and why I feel like I’m just circling the drain. I think it’s because I’m stuck straddling two modes: trying to be effective and efficient, while also trying to produce things that people actually care about. And honestly, I’ve been thinking about all of it the wrong way.

Take Substack and Medium, for example. I’ve been treating them like some kind of secret weapon, like I’m hiding something powerful I don’t want others to know about. That’s ridiculous. Maybe the better approach is to treat them as open documentation spaces—places where I show what I’m doing, how I’m doing it. It’s always been about experimentation. But I’ve been getting caught up in this “creator” mentality.

You know what? If someone reads what I write and gets value from it, great. But I’m not doing this to profit. So who cares what I write? Hell, I could let AI help generate some of it, as long as I’m honest about that. What matters is that I document the journey.

Medium is a bit different. It’s not so much about niche topics—it’s broader, more topic-driven. People might follow you, sure, but they’re not expecting you to show up in their inbox. Substack, on the other hand, is more personal. So maybe that’s the distinction: Substack is for detailed documentation and process—what I’m doing, what I’m learning—while Medium is for more refined, one-off pieces based on that work.

For example, when I’m working on ethics or building pseudo-agents, there’s a lot I have to figure out. Each of those things could become small, focused articles. So maybe I use GPT to pull together summaries—“Here’s what I wrote on Substack this month”—and share those. Maybe I even collect all of it in a single notebook. That could be the real narrative. That could make this fun again.

Because right now? It’s not fun. I’m not entertained. I’m not producing. I’m spinning my wheels. And that’s not worth it.

### Reframing Substack and Medium

With this new mindset, I know I’m going to hate myself a little, but I need to go back and redo some of the foundational stuff. There’s a process to all this, and I skipped some key steps. For instance, I wrote about getting started—how to set up GitHub—but I didn’t actually write about *why* that matters or what it looks like in real-world terms.

That’s a mistake.

What I should be doing on Substack is documenting that real, no-bullshit journey. Step-by-step. It’s not always sexy, but it’s hands-on. It’s useful. That’s where the real value lies. If you want to build something meaningful today, you can’t just think like a designer—you have to start thinking like a developer, or at least start using developer tools.

We’ve spent years as designers trying to earn a seat at the table, but most of us haven’t behaved like the teams we're trying to influence. We treat engineers like obstacles instead of customers. But they *are* our customers. They’re the ones interpreting our designs into real products. That’s why I get so annoyed about things like screen specs—they don’t get what we’re trying to communicate, because we’ve never really taken the time to understand what *they* need.

So again: I need to document all this. Why I’m doing it. What the setup looks like. Keep an ongoing log of what’s working and what’s not—like the GitHub repository mess from the other day. That’s the raw source material. That’s what I’ll mine for Medium posts later.

I need to stop thinking of Substack as a marketing channel and start seeing it for what it is: my real workbench. It’s where the experiments happen. Medium is where the polished insights go.

That feels much more aligned with how I naturally work. And yeah—it actually sounds kind of fun.

### Next Steps and Structure

I’ll keep using markup languages for structure, but the first real piece needs to be about this realization—that this is my starting point. I’ve been moving toward this since my last post about getting busy and outlining a plan.

I’ll probably need to repurpose a lot of my Substack content, which sucks a bit, but it’s necessary to make it more specific and better organized. Maybe I build out sections—some of the stuff I publish to Medium can get its own section in Substack. That way, people can follow the broader journey or dive into specific areas.

This is basically my “getting started” page in the making.

Over time, I’ll develop content pillars—things like managing materials, building pseudo-agents, creating processes. I’ll just let it grow. I won’t start pushing things to Medium or LinkedIn until I’ve got a functioning pipeline in place.

And LinkedIn… yeah, I need to clean that up. There’s a lot of dumb stuff on there. Probably best to quietly remove anything I wouldn’t want someone stumbling across right away.

Let me know if you’d like this turned into a blog post draft, Substack outline, or something else.

I've been thinking about this writing and why I feel oh way why I am circling the drain really I think it's because I'm straddling what I'm trying to do to be effective and efficient and get trying to get to the point where I think that I'll be producing things people care about i've been thinking about that wrong. I think I've been thinking about how I'm gonna use. Sub stack and medium wrong as wow, just some degree. I think that there is gonna be interest in in what I am doing for myself and for whatever reason I thought of is some super big secret don't tell anyone it's my secret weapon whatever bullshit but I think that maybe that's the wrong approach maybe it that is is where I document what I'm doing how I'm doing it it's always been about experimentation and somehow I'm getting caught up in this creator mentality and you know what if people read benefit from it great it's not like I'm out to profit so who gives a fuck what I write fuck if I just make AI write it and call it a day as long as I'm honest about it of course but with that in my mind, I start to think about medium where the articles are different right it's not niche topics so much is just kind of topics in general that may or may not surface right there's no one they might follow you but they're not asking you to show up in their email and I think that's really the big difference right one hand I'm documenting what I'm doing and I'm having to learn stuff along the way, so why not do you like one off detailed pieces right so doing ethics I'm figuring out you know what why the how well how what it looks like those are all concepts that could all be you know small articles and medium so basically I'm doing what I'm going to get better what I'm doing and then I'm just throwing out the tidbits as they come up and I can i can make a GPT or something you know and these are the things I published this month these are the things I wrote in my sub stack this month search online see what anyone cares about and if if so, pitch me ideas I might actually do that was notebook, but or I could do it with all three and then put all of it into notebook and get the some of the story that's much smarter but then that helps me it gets me out of the right and makes it more entertaining again cause I think that's part of what's lost. I'm not entertained anymore. I'm not producing anything. I'm going in circles. It's just not fun now and it's not worth doing it if that's the

So with that mindset, let's think about and I know I know I'm gonna hate myself, but I'm going to have to go back and redo some of this shit, but I'm going to get up for example right there is a process. There is a bunch of stuff you have to do to get set up and I didn't really write any I wrote how to get started how to set up your GitHub, but I didn't really put the this is a perfect example. This was about generating content instead of documenting real world, what's and wise from someone who has 30 your experience right learn you don't just charge into a project. Make sure you got someplace to keep your shit. Otherwise it becomes a that's fast, but I should be writing about the step-by-step of what I'm doing in my sub stack cause that's the real value but yeah it's not. It's not sexy. It's but engaging much of the time it's not interesting, but it is hands on no bullshit. This is what you wanna do if you wanna make it today and you ask you gotta quit being a designer part of the time and start thinking like a developer the very least you need to start using the tools because things are turning into text driven things maybe not code but it's still words in files Wilmar and all of that but also the reality that we then we artists designers whatever have been trying to get our seat at the table for years and the reality is we never really sorry as I know there been something for the most part, we've never really behaved like the teams were doing UX to inform are our customers because reality is we collectively have a set of customers but for designers those engineers are your customer too I know I get bitchy about who the one who screens but it's because that's that's the part they don't get right because they understand the value that customers will get through the screens, not your lost DIA diagrams are you participating on what they really need over there whatever anyway I'm getting carried away so so I get out again. I document the set and that I can turn that into a getting started I dock document why I'm doing it right who document why would it took keep a updated log of the trials and tribulations like that repository shit the other day and that's the real source material for whatever you wanna put on medium you need to stop thinking of Substack as the place you want to get traffic from our spread the word whatever and do is there a medium sub stack sub stack becomes your source material right? That's the real material you put the research the outcomes what you did all of that there and then use that to write miracles from medium, and that I think is going to be far more enjoyable and actually fit how you approach things yeah and it sounds fun

I think the well I'll keep the mark up languages, but I think the first piece is really just that this this revelation mass no, this is this is where I've been since I posted my other thing about how I'm getting busy an outline what I'm getting, you know my plan this is my approach. I will have to repurpose most of the subs that content which kind of sucks to be you know more specific to what's happening and that's probably sections right maybe the stuff I shit out of medium goes into a section and then people can read the stuff forget to blow by below. That's actually probably pretty and this is kind of a way to get started page and making and then i'll end up you know I'll have a content pillar on you know managing your materials you know pillars on what I'm actually you know certain process making making your pseudo agents and all that just let it grow overtime. Wait until I actually got a functioning pipeline and that's probably when it's a good time to start posting medium or LinkedIn on occasion, but I gotta gotta be careful with LinkedIn. I gotta go back and clean LinkedIn up and sit down a lot of dumb shit so I should probably eradicate that from the easiest place to find it

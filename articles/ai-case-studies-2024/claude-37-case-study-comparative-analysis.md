## 5. Synthesis & Recommendations

### Best Practices

- Use concrete examples to illustrate evaluation or behavior clearly.
- Blend narrative and analytical styles for deeper engagement where appropriate.
- Progressively layer complexity to enhance reader understanding.
- Balance visual aids (tables, structure mapping) with textual insight.

### Recommendations

- Adopt a **standard evaluation scaffold** (e.g., common scoring rubric) for cross-case comparability.
- Increase use of **visual formatting**, especially for structure-sensitive topics.
- Clearly state **methodological limitations** to aid replicability and transparency.
- Promote **scenario-based testing** for richer insight into adaptive model behavior.

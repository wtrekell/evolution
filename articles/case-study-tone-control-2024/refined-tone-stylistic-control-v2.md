## Case Study: Tone & Stylistic Control

### Overview

In mid-2024, a focused series of experiments examined how tone direction influenced the quality, cultural appropriateness, and reader engagement of AI-generated content. These trials—concentrated in May and June but extended across later months—revealed that tone specification was a key lever for increasing clarity, cultural resonance, and stylistic fidelity. However, the experiments also exposed challenges in tone consistency and interpretability, highlighting the need for more structured, adaptable approaches to tone control.

### Challenge

As expectations for AI-generated content evolved, a recurring shortfall was the lack of tonal clarity. Unspecified tone often led to output that was technically correct but emotionally flat and culturally shallow. This exposed a critical gap: AI could structure content, but could it speak with the right voice?

The challenge was threefold:

1. Determine whether tone instructions improved content engagement and appropriateness.
2. Assess whether models could maintain consistent tone over longer articles or multi-day tasks.
3. Identify how structure and prompt design could better support tonal fidelity without diminishing model performance.

These trials sought to elevate AI content beyond correctness, toward resonance—where tone plays a central role in quality, relevance, and reception.

### Experiments & Evidence

#### Approach

The experiments followed a systematic framework to test how tone influenced AI performance. Each monthly trial isolated tonal variation by pairing control and treatment prompts. Roles were defined with embedded tone instructions, and templates were chosen to test structural alignment. Models were evaluated on tone fidelity, clarity, engagement, and cultural nuance.

Specifically:

* **Prompt Pairing**: For each tone, a parallel "toneless" control was generated to identify performance deltas.
* **Role Encoding**: Tone was declared in role descriptions to anchor stylistic intent.
* **Format-Aware Structuring**: Templates used JSON, YAML, XML, or Markdown to study tone compliance under varying scaffolds.
* **Multi-Model Testing**: GPT-4, Claude, Bard, and Gemini were used to assess cross-model variance.
* **Rubric-Driven Scoring**: Outputs were graded using evolving rubrics that emphasized depth, engagement, and cultural fit.
* **Month-over-Month Analysis**: Insights from one trial informed refinements in structure, evaluation, and tone calibration in the next.

#### May–June: Tone Variation Trials

The most concentrated experimentation occurred around Golden Week and Eid al-Adha coverage. Each model received the same base prompt, varied only by tone.

* **Engagement**: Journalistic and personal tones scored highest for readability and emotional connection. Academic tones were valued for clarity and depth. Conversational tone helped with visual content. Excited tone underperformed—engaging but often superficial.
* **Appropriateness**: Professional and respectful tones enhanced cultural sensitivity. Evaluators flagged detached, casual, or insular tones as inappropriate.
* **Consistency**: Claude struggled to maintain tone in longer chains. GPT-4 needed refinement loops to stabilize tone. Scoring bias emerged, especially around subjectively appealing tones like "excited" or "personal."

#### August: Narrative Consistency Stress Test

Claude’s tone performance degraded across multi-section, longform content. Even with a well-defined initial tone, later sections drifted toward neutrality. Tighter structural prompts and reminder annotations were introduced mid-output but required re-prompting to be effective. Gemini demonstrated minimal tone persistence and required more frequent tone restatement.

#### September: Format-Tone Alignment

This month aimed to identify how structural markup influenced tone stability. The hypothesis was that clear, structured templates could preserve tone more effectively than loosely defined ones.

* **GPT-4** sustained tone most effectively using **JSON**, thanks to its hierarchical encoding of both role and tone.
* **Claude** excelled with **YAML** and **XML**, benefiting from its strength in nested reasoning.
* **Gemini** struggled with over-structured formats, reverting to generic tone.
* **Bard** showed improvement with YAML but failed to preserve tone using JSON.

Results confirmed that tone adherence was not just about the tone instruction—it was about its placement and encoding within the structure.

#### October: Adaptive Tone in Mixed Content

Experiments introduced content that required tonal transitions—factual lead-ins followed by narrative or reflective endings. This tested whether AI could vary tone within a single piece. Claude responded well, smoothly blending tones in cultural features. GPT-4 showed partial adaptability but often reverted to its opening tone. Bard defaulted to neutrality when shifting was required.

#### November: Rubric Overhaul

The motivation for the rubric revision stemmed from inconsistent scoring in earlier trials. Personal and excited tones, in particular, drew varied reactions—sometimes penalized for informality, sometimes praised for connection.

* New dimensions were added: **emotional resonance**, **cultural humility**, and **tone execution stability**.
* Re-analysis of prior outputs upgraded several scores, especially for personal tone in Eid and Diwali pieces.
* Evaluator agreement increased after more explicit definitions were added to distinguish between genuine enthusiasm and performative energy.

#### December: Prompt Complexity Coding

December’s trials extended the existing four-variable matrix—Role, Structure, Context, Constraints—by formally introducing **Tone Complexity** as a fifth axis. This addition acknowledged tone as a distinct prompt engineering dimension.

* GPT-4 and GPT-4o analyses showed that increasing tone complexity (e.g., layered tonal goals like Professional + Emotional or Reflective + Descriptive) elevated engagement and improved perceived content sophistication, though not to the same degree as role specificity or structural depth.
* Claude consistently demonstrated narrative gains when tone expectations were expressed in greater detail—generating outputs that were more nuanced and culturally attuned.
* This extension of the complexity model enabled more targeted prompt configurations and provided a formal basis for evaluating tone as an independent contributor to content quality.

Prompt complexity was encoded using a four-digit system (role, structure, context, constraints). This allowed clearer tracking of where tone succeeded or failed.

* GPT-4 and GPT-4o performed best on **4322** configurations, where tone was specified at all levels.
* Claude maintained tone on **3xxx** prompts but showed drift when faced with layered constraints.
* This coding enabled more precise experimentation and set the stage for prompt engineering automation in 2025.

### Findings

#### Scoring Behavior Around Tone

Model scoring patterns revealed systemic inconsistencies, particularly when evaluating tone-driven outputs:

* **Claude** frequently clustered high scores regardless of tone execution quality, showing poor calibration—especially under “Excited” or “No Tone” conditions.
* **Gemini** exhibited erratic tone-based scoring, often disregarding format structure and inconsistently reflecting tone intent.
* **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, acting as an evaluator in later tests, explicitly scored for "Respectful Tone" and upwardly recalibrated several outputs during November re-evaluations.
* **ChatGPT-4o** demonstrated a contrasting pattern—downward recalibration during re-evaluation phases in late-year trials, showing increased scrutiny on tone appropriateness and emotional alignment.

#### Tone–Structure Interaction Findings

Stronger tonal directives often led to better adherence to structural prompts. In multiple trials, tone clarity improved not just style but format fidelity. For example, GPT-4’s “Professional” tone runs reduced missing section headers by 25% compared to “Creative” tone equivalents, suggesting that formal tones support more disciplined formatting.

This effect was especially notable in structured templates (JSON, YAML), where tone and section guidance reinforced one another—enhancing overall task compliance.

| Model  | Best Format for Tone | Notable Behaviors                                                |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GPT-4  | JSON                 | Required clear, nested structure to sustain tone across sections |
| Claude | YAML, XML            | Performed well with tone-embedded templates                      |
| Gemini | Markdown             | Better with loose tone; struggled under rigid tone constraints   |
| Bard   | YAML                 | Inconsistent tone handling; better with directive templates      |

### Style Control Framework

In response to these findings, the following framework outlines tactical methods for ensuring tone fidelity and contextual alignment in structured outputs.

#### 1. Tone Within Role Definitions

Incorporate tone directly into role descriptions:

> *e.g., "You are a Cultural Correspondent writing in a journalistic and appreciative tone.”*

#### 2. Tone Sections in Templates

Define stylistic expectations (e.g., clarity, vividness, cultural respect) within article templates.

#### 3. Prompt-Based Tone Instructions

Break complex tonal requests into clear segments:

> Ineffective: "Write in a warm tone."
>
> Effective: "Write in a personal and reflective tone that emphasizes gratitude and cultural appreciation."
> *"Use a professional tone with culturally sensitive language. Begin with a contextual overview, then proceed narratively."*

#### 4. Structured Markup

JSON and XML templates helped embed tone guidance explicitly, ensuring tone persisted alongside structure.

### Implications & Recommendations

Deliberate tone specification consistently improved content resonance and cultural fit, especially when supported by structured prompts and format-compatible templates. However, tone quality varied across models and scenarios, reinforcing the need for modular design, rubric clarity, and better mid-output correction methods. While structured tone scaffolding improved outcomes across models, Claude in particular benefitted from nested YAML guidance, GPT-4 excelled with explicit role and section nesting, and Gemini remained sensitive to structural rigidity.

* **Specify tone early and clearly**—ideally in both role and template.
* **Match tone to content type and cultural context**—don’t assume one-size-fits-all.
* **Avoid over-reliance on high-emotion tones**—especially for sensitive topics.
* **Use structured formats to reinforce tone compliance**—markup-supported prompts showed higher tonal consistency.
* **Refine evaluation continuously**—rubrics must evolve to reflect the nuances of tone.

### Next Steps

* **Expand Tone Coding Systems**: Develop a standardized tone taxonomy aligned to prompt complexity and format.
* **Automate Tone Drift Detection**: Prototype lightweight tools to flag mid-output tone loss in longer content.
* **Test Dynamic Tone Blending**: Formalize experiments with intentional tone shifts across structured sections.
* **Continue Multi-Model Benchmarks**: Maintain cross-platform comparisons as models evolve in tone compliance behavior.
* **Refine Cultural Sensitivity Scoring**: Extend rubric criteria for tone missteps beyond generic labels like "disrespectful."

> **Final Note:** The most successful outputs blended tonal clarity with contextual appropriateness. Rather than prescribing a single "best" tone, the experiments highlight the value of deliberate tone-context alignment and adaptive authoring strategies.

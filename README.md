# Quiet Evolution Repository

This repository supports the Quiet Evolution publication, a project exploring practical and ethical applications of AI in design and technical workflows. It serves as both a content archive and a research log — tracking the evolution of ideas, documenting experiments, and publishing results.

## Purpose

Quiet Evolution exists to cut through the AI hype by documenting hands-on experimentation, practical design frameworks, and evidence-based guidance for creative and technical professionals. The goal is to bridge design thinking and AI capabilities in a way that is transparent, ethical, and useful.

This repository houses:
- Self-contained article folders with drafts, prompts, data, and assets
- A centralized article index
- Visual and text-based documentation of the creative pipeline
- Scripts and templates that support publishing and experimentation
